Network Simulation with NS-3
Project Overview

This project focuses on network simulation using the NS-3 discrete-event network simulator. It is divided into two main parts, each designed to explore different aspects of network behavior, protocol performance, and dynamic routing under failure conditions.

    Part 1: Simulates a simple point-to-point connection between two nodes using UDP Echo applications
    to analyze basic traffic flow metrics.

    Part 2: Constructs a more complex multi-node network topology to investigate dynamic routing, 
    packet flow management, and the impact of link failures on packet loss and network performance.

The simulation is implemented using a combination of C++ and Python (via the NS-3 Python bindings).
